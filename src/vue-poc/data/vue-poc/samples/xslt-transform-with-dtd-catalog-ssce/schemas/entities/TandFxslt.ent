<!-- 
TandFxslt.ent - This file may be used to override (pre-declare) character 
entities in a local environment when processing TFJA XML and output of 
character entities is desired instead of the automatic resolution of 
character entities performed by most XML processors, for example when 
converting TFJA to other formats using an XSLT processor. In the publicly 
hosted version of TFJA DTD this file should contain only a declaration for 
the TandFxsltEscape parameter entity.

The TandFxsltEscape parameter entity is intended to be used in place of the 
ampersand character when declaring overrides for character entities. This 
avoids circular-definition and automatic-resolution problems that would 
otherwise be encountered. The escape sequence defined by TandFxsltEscape 
should be replaced with an ampersand (&) during processing, either as part of 
the XSLT or using a simple search-and-replace.

When converting between TFJA and another DTD, a mapping should be done between 
the character entities defined in TFJA and the character entities defined in 
the output DTD. The mapping should be created in a local file containing entity 
declarations for each mapped character entity. The local file should be 
invoked instead of the public version of this file, for example by using a 
catalog file.

Character entities that appear in both DTDs may be preserved by 
creating a declaration using the escape sequence and the entity name. 
For example:
<!ENTITY Bgr "%TandFxsltEscape;Bgr;" >
With this declaration &Bgr; in source text will output as &Bgr;

Character entities that appear only in TFJA should map to a unicode entity or
a unicode value. For example to map to a unicode entity:
<!ENTITY Aopf "%TandFxsltEscape;#x1D538;" >
With this declaration &Aopf; in source text will output as &#x1D538;

If output of unicode is allowed the escape sequence is not necessary:
<!ENTITY Aopf "&#x1D538;" >
With this declaration &Aopf; in source text will output as unicode character #x1D538




This entity file must be defined in the DTD before any other character entities 
are defined. Typical invocation in DTD:
<!ENTITY % TandFxslt
           PUBLIC "-//TandF//ENTITIES Character Entity Overrides for XSLT//EN" 
           "../entities/TandFxslt.ent">
%TandFxslt;


Typical invocation for entry in an OASIS TR9401 catalog file is:
PUBLIC "-//TandF//ENTITIES Character Entity Overrides for XSLT//EN" "LocalCustomTandFxslt.ent"
SYSTEM "..\entities\TandFxslt.ent" "LocalCustomTandFxslt.ent"


Typical character entity definition using parameter entity:
<!ENTITY alpha "%TandFxsltEscape;alpha;" >

Typical character entity definition using escape sequence:
<!ENTITY alpha "[xsltescapecharent]alpha;" >

-->

<!ENTITY % TandFxsltEscape "[xsltescapecharent]" ><!-- Escape sequence -->
