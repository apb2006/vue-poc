Parameter entity definition for Unicode Plane 1 characters in range 1D000 - 1DFFF.
The default definition "&#38;38;#x1D" allows entities to resolve to correct Unicode characters using standard XML parsers.
This definition may be changed for use with parsers (such as nsgmls) that do not yet support Unicode Plane 1 characters.
