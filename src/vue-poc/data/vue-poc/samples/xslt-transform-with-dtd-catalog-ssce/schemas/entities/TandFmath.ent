Math operators and symbols identified during the XML tagging process 
by Taylor & Francis vendors or Taylor & Francis internal staff.

Idenitification and mapping are handled adhoc based on the type of
operator and specific requirements for display.

Mapping may be based on the specific character requirements, though
mapping to Unicode is preferred. Where Unicode mapping is not possible 
(character cannot currently be represented in Unicode) the entity 
value should be declared with the entity name concatenated within 
square brackets. Example: <!ENTITY Abar "[Abar]">

Graphics for web rendering should be indicated in the description field.
Every attempt should be made to use the same name for the graphic as 
used in the replacement string with recognition of operating system
limitations in recognition of upper/lower case filenames with the same 
characters. Uppercase characters are indicated by inserting a low bar "_"
between the base character and the diacritical for the name of the gif 
file. Lower case is concatenated with the diacritical. Example: 
&agr; vs. &Agr; would require filenames of agr.gif and A_gr.gif.

<!-- Typical invocation for XML.DCL entry in catalog entry is:

PUBLIC "-//TandF//ENTITIES Specific Math Operators//EN" "entities/TandFmath.ent">
SYSTEM "..\entities\TandFmath.ent" "entities\TandFmath.ent"

<!--
Because there are cases when the ISO greek character and the named character are used differently. 
Specifically, the characters found in ISO-grk1 represent the same basic letter  forms found in ISO-grk4. 
grk1 is used for text while grk4 is used for mathematical expressions. Example: mgr is the alphabetic 
form of Greek 'm', however, 'mu' is the same character form. Use of the proper entity allows 
differentiation via emphasis formatting (i.e. italics) on output.

<!-- Greek with Diacriticals -->
<!ENTITY omegadot        "[omegadot]"><!-- Greek Omega with Dot -->
<!-- The alternative is the following -->
<!ENTITY ohgrdot         "&#x003C9;&#x00307;"><!-- GREEK SMALL LETTER OMEGA WITH DOT ABOVE -->

<!ENTITY b.epsis         "%plane1D;6C6;"><!-- mathematical bold small epsilon -->
<!ENTITY b.equals        "&#x0003D;"><!-- bold equals : no direct unicode - aliasing ISONUM equals -->
<!ENTITY b.infin         "&#x0221E;"><!-- bold infinity : no direct unicode - aliasing ISOTECH infin -->
<!ENTITY b.nabla         "%plane1D;6C1;"><!-- mathematical bold nabla -->
<!ENTITY b.phis          "%plane1D;6D7;"><!-- mathematical bold small phi -->
